KR (Kirjalliset Runot) - Corpus of Finnish Literary Poems in Kalevalameter (1658â€“1866)

Corpus is created for use in research and it contains published folk poetry, literary poems and songs (mostly) in Finnish and Karelian, and the Estonian literary epic Kalevipoeg (1857). The works used in the corpus are published in 1658-1908, but all the poems are written or colleted before the year 1867. 

The corpus consist of Ilo-laulu Jesuxesta (1690), versions of Kalevala (1835 and 1849; vanhakalevala and kalevala), Kanteletar (1840), Kalevipoeg (1857) and smaller works (kr01-53). Collectors table includes also some publishers. Places table only contains one publishing place, which is not contained in the SKVR and JR places table. The metadata of the corpus contains errors and will be checked later.

The corpus was created by Sakari Korpikallio under supervision of Kati Kallio and Maciej Janicki as part of the Research Council of Finland projects FILTER (funding no. 333138) and REFOP (no. 340647) at the Finnish Literature Society and University of Helsinki. 

Main goal of KR was to create a comparative corpus for SKVR and JR corpora of Finnic oral poems. The comparison shows various kinds of relationships between oral and literary cultures during modernization of Finnic areas.

Material is gathered from publications mentioned in the metadata and free to use online sources such as Corpus of Old Literary Finnish by Kotus (Institute for the Languages in Finland), Doria (Multi-institutional repository maintained by National Library of Finland), Digital Archives of the National Library of Finland and Project Gutenberg.

KR corpus data is provided free to use, provided that the Finnish Literature Society SKS and the projects involved (FILTER and REFOP) are mentioned as the original compilers.
